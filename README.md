# Connect-Four-Bot
Second project for the subject Artificial Inteligence, which consisted in developing a bot to play the Connect Four Game using adversarial search.
Our implementation was in C++.


### Search functions implemented
* Minimax
* Alpha-Beta Prunning


### Compilation
``` bash
$ g++ -O3 main.cpp -o main
```

### Usage
The usage of this project is intuitive. It's instructions appear when the program is executed.


### Files
* main.cpp - Requests input and calls the search functions.
* Node.h - Implementation of the graph node's.
* Board.h 	- Implementation of the game board and functions to work with the board.
* Minimax.h - Implementation of the Minimax algorithm.
* Alphabeta.h - Implementation of the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.


### Bot vs Bot
To have two bots play against each other, just uncomment line 122 in file main.cpp.
